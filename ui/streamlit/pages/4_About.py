This is a Proof of Concept application which shows how Google Vertex AI Generative AI can be used with Neo4j to build and consume Knowledge Graphs using Video Transcripts.
Transcript data are from [AFL after-match Commentary](https://www.afl.com.au/ondemand/shows/490977/access-all-areas?episode=1#2023).
Using Google Vertex AI Generative AI's `text-bison` and `code-bison` models, transcripts are converted to Knowledge Graph.

### Why Neo4j is a great addition to Google Generative AI:
- *Fine-grained access control of your data* : You can control who can and cannot access parts of your data
- Greater reliability with factual data
- More Explainability
- Domain specificity
- Ability to gain insights using Graph Algorithms
- Vector embedding support and Similarity Algorithms on Neo4j
